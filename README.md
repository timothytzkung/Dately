# Welcome to Dately 👋

Dately is a mobile application designed to help couples plan memorable dates effortlessly by leveraging AI and location-based services. The app addresses the common challenge of deciding what to do on dates by generating personalized itineraries based on user preferences, budget constraints, and available attractions in their area. Users can customize their preferences through a questionnaire system, generate date plans with detailed itineraries including venues and costs, save their favorite date ideas, and create digital scrapbooks with photos from their dates. Built with React Native and Expo, Dately provides a cross-platform solution that combines intelligent date planning with memory preservation, making it easier for couples to spend quality time together while creating lasting memories
